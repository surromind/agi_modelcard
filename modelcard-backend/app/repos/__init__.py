"""
The 'repos' directory contains SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) definitions and repositories
for database interactions in this project.

Directory Structure:
- 'repos/' contains Python modules defining ORM models and data access repositories.
- Each module typically defines database tables as ORM models and provides functions or classes
  for performing database operations (e.g., CRUD operations) related to those models.

Usage:
- The 'repos' directory is responsible for encapsulating the database schema and data access logic,
  making it easier to interact with the database in a structured and organized manner.
- Developers can use the ORM models and repository functions/classes defined here to perform
  database operations without needing to write raw SQL queries.

Note:
- Keep the 'repos' directory organized and maintain clear documentation within each module
  to ensure efficient database interactions and code maintainability.
